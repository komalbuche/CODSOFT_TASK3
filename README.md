Welcome to my CODSOFT Java Development Internship repository! This repository contains all the tasks completed during my internship with CODSOFT. 
It showcases my progress and efforts in learning and applying Java programming concepts.
TASK 3:

1.Create a class to represent the ATM machine.

2. Design the user interface for the ATM, including options such as withdrawing, depositing, and
checking the balance.

3. Implement methods for each option, such as withdraw(amount), deposit(amount), and
checkBalance().

4. Create a class to represent the user's bank account, which stores the account balance.

5. Connect the ATM class with the user's bank account class to access and modify the account
balance.

6. Validate user input to ensure it is within acceptable limits (e.g., sufficient balance for withdrawals).

7. Display appropriate messages to the user based on their chosen options and the success or failure
of their transactions.

ATM INTERFACE

Each task folder contains a README file with detailed information about the task and how to run the corresponding program. 
Code is organized into individual task folders for easy navigation and review. 
A video showcasing my work and a demo of my efforts will be hosted on LinkedIn for credibility and proof of work.
